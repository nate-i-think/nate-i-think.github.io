      <p>My grandfather sits asleep, well, not quite asleep; you can tell by the way he shifts in his chair, gently stretching his toes and repositioning his arms as the small talk from the kitchen ebbs and flows. A bird chirps, metronomically; I look for it; I find it in a tree; it darts away off across the pasture, yellow grass punctured by lattice transmission towers and grazing cattle. Beasley looks a lot like his owner, I think, as he sits there in my grandfather’s lap, long eyelashes and aged fur, an old dog resting on the leg of an old man. Occasionally, both of their eyes flick open, to assess their surroundings.</p>

      <h3 id="xx1-introduction">xX.1 Introduction.</h3>
<p>I was inspired to make this today—well, yesterday by now—by <a href="https://knosmos.github.io/brownian/">a website</a> of my good friend, Jiereui Chang. Yes, the form—and title especially—are quite derivative. But I hope here I am able to create something unique of my own. Or at least something that justifies the silly amount of time I put into making this overly complicated LaTeX-themed Liquid template.<br />

<h3 id="xx2-reasoning">xX.2 Reasoning.</h3>
<p><em>Stochastic Drift</em> in the context of physical systems refers to gradual and cumulative changes in a system over time due to probabilistic influences and noise.</p>
